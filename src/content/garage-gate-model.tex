\section{State machine introduction}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A garage gate fundamentally have 2 main states, the \textit{Opened} and \textit{Closed} states, which is shown below on \figref{Garage Statemachine} figure, with orange colours. First of all we can start from the \textit{Closed} state, where we can open the gate with an 'open' command. This command sets the state machine in an \textit{Opening} state. While opening the gate, somebody or something can move into the way, so this becomes \textit{Block Opening}. The gate is opening, if the blocking stops. After the \textit{Opening} phase succeeded the gate is \textit{Opened}. In this state we can 'close' the gate with a simple command, and the state machine goes to the \textit{Closing} state. There could be also a blocking action, which stops the closing movement. From this state the gate is starting the closing movement again after a few seconds \textit{Lighting}. When the closing action finished the gate is \textit{Closed}
